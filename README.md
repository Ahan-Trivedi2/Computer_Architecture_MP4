# Computer_Architecture_MP4

Collection of design files for Miniproject 4 for Ahan Trivedi, Ishan Porwal, Nividh Singh, and Ertug Umsur. 

In this project, we designed a single-cycle, 32-bit RISC-V microprocessor using SystemVerilog and the OSS CAD Suite. Our processor implements the full RV32I instruction set (excluding system and atomic instructions) and uses a Von Neumann memory architecture with support for memory-mapped peripherals. We verified its functionality through simulation and demonstrated its ability to run an LED-blinking RISC-V program on the iceBlinkPico board.
