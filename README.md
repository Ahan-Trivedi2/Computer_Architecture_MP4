# Computer_Architecture_MP4

This repository contains the design files for Miniproject 4, completed by Ahan Trivedi, Ishan Porwal, Nividh Singh, and Ertug Umsur for the Computer Architecture course at Olin College of Engineering (Spring 2025).

In this project, we designed a multi-cycle, unpipelined 32-bit RISC-V microprocessor using SystemVerilog and the OSS CAD Suite. Our processor implements the full RV32I instruction set (excluding system and atomic instructions) and uses a Von Neumann memory architecture with support for memory-mapped peripherals. We verified its functionality through simulation and demonstrated its ability to run an LED-blinking RISC-V program on the iceBlinkPico board.
